# Downloader App

A self-hosted media management platform built with Symfony & Python, packaged as a single Docker image. It handles video/torrent downloads via Alldebrid and provides a complete music pipeline — from Spotify search to tagged, organized files in your library.

Project repo : https://github.com/Gautardos/downloader

---

## ✨ Features

### 🎬 Videos & Torrents
- **Magnet & `.torrent` upload** with Alldebrid cloud debridding.
- **Built-in search engine** — local CSV database for searching torrents by title and auto-filling magnets.
- **Magnet preview** — inspect file list, sizes and Alldebrid status before committing.
- **Pack grouping** — automatic detection of series/albums with recursive folder creation.
- **Batch folder creation** — one-click creation of all missing directories during bulk import.
- **AI-assisted renaming** — Grok suggests clean, normalized file names (✨ button, hidden when no Grok key).

### 🎵 Music (Music Explorer)
- **Spotify search** — search tracks/albums directly from the UI using the Spotify Web API.
- **High-quality downloads** — powered by CLI tools (zotify/spotdl) with configurable quality up to `very_high`.
- **Full ID3 tag editor** — Artist, Album, Title, Year, Genre, Track Number.
- **Lyrics** — automatic fetching of synced LRC lyrics (LRCLib) and plain-text lyrics (Genius).
- **AI genre classification** — automatic genre tagging via Grok with a fully customizable expert prompt.
- **Regex genre mapping** — alternative rule-based genre classification with configurable JSON patterns.
- **Library automation** — move, rename, and organize files into `Artist/Artist - Album - Track - Title.ext`.
- **Spotify authentication** — generate Spotify credentials directly from Settings via the built-in `librespot-auth` binary.

### 🛠️ System
- **Download queue** — sequential processing via a background worker (Supervisor-managed).
- **Real-time tracker** — live download progress with polling and browser notifications.
- **Full history** — detailed action logs with retention limit.
- **Authentication** — simple login system with configurable credentials (default: `admin` / `admin`).
- **Adaptive UI** — navigation items are hidden automatically when their dependencies are not configured.
- **JSON storage** — no SQL database needed; all configuration, history, and queue are stored as JSON files.

## � Installation (Docker)

The application is distributed as a pre-built Docker image.

### Prerequisites
- **Docker** and **Docker Compose** installed on a Linux host.
- An **Alldebrid** account (for video/torrent features).
- A **Spotify** developer account (for music features).
- Optionally, a **Grok** API key (for AI renaming and genre detection).

### 1. Create the project directory

```bash
mkdir -p ~/downloader-app/var/home
mkdir -p ~/downloader-app/var/storage
```

- `var/home/` — persistent home directory for the application (Spotify credentials, archive logs).
- `var/storage/` — persistent application data (configuration, download queue, history).

### 2. Modify `docker-compose.yml`

### 3. Start the container

```bash
cd ~/downloader-app
docker compose up -d
```

The application is now accessible at **`http://<your-ip>:8000`**.

### 4. First login

Open the application in your browser. The default credentials are:

| Field    | Value   |
| -------- | ------- |
| Username | `admin` |
| Password | `admin` |

> [!TIP]
> Change these immediately in **Settings → Admin User / Admin Password**.

## 🎵 Spotify Setup

The music features require two independent Spotify configurations:

### 1. Spotify API Credentials (for metadata search)

1. Go to the [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard).
2. Log in and click **"Create app"**.
3. Fill in a name (e.g., `My Downloader`) and a redirect URI (e.g., `http://localhost:8000/callback`).
4. Save, then go to **Settings** on the app page.
5. Copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** into the application's Settings page.

### 2. Spotify Authentication (for music downloads)

The download engine needs a valid Spotify session stored as a `credentials.json` file.

**From the UI (recommended):**
1. Go to **Settings**.
2. Click the **⚡ Auth** button next to "JSON Credentials Path".
3. Open Spotify on your phone/desktop and select the device named `Speaker <timestamp>` as output (you need to have both devices on the same wifi).
4. The credentials file is generated, transformed, and stored automatically.

> [!NOTE]
> The ⚡ Auth button only appears when no credentials file exists at the configured path.

## 🏗️ Architecture

The Docker container runs three services managed by **Supervisor**:

| Service | Role |
| ------- | ---- |
| **Apache** | Serves the Symfony application on port 8000 |
| **Redis** | Stores PHP sessions (prevents session lock contention) |
| **Download Worker** | Background process that sequentially processes the download queue |

### Volume mapping explained

```
Host                                    → Container
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
~/downloader-app/var/home               → /var/www/html/var/home        (Spotify creds, logs)
~/downloader-app/var/storage            → /var/www/html/var/storage     (config, queue, history)
/downloads                              → /downloads                    (torrent/video output)
/music                                  → /music                        (music output)
```

> [!WARNING]
> Paths configured in the Settings page refer to **container-internal** paths. If you mount `/music` on the host, set `Music Root Path` to `/music` in Settings — not the host path.

## � How Alldebrid Works

The application is **not** a BitTorrent client. It delegates P2P downloads to the [Alldebrid](https://alldebrid.com) cloud service:

1. **Submit** — magnet link or `.torrent` file uploaded via the dashboard.
2. **Cloud download** — Alldebrid fetches the content on its high-speed servers.
3. **Link extraction** — the API returns direct HTTP links for each file in the torrent once ready.
4. **Debridding** — each link is "unlocked" for full-speed direct download.
5. **Local transfer** — the background worker downloads files to your local storage directory.

## 📝 Notes

- The application uses a file-based JSON storage system (`JsonStorage`) which avoids the need for any SQL database. All data persists in the `var/storage/` directory.
- Redis is used **only** for PHP session storage to prevent session lock contention during Ajax polling.
- The `librespot-auth` binary is compiled from Rust source during the Docker image build. It is included in the image and does not need to be installed separately.
